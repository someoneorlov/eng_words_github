turn out,"You never can tell in these cases how they’re going to turn out and it’s best to be on the safe side. <br><br> ""Yes, unless you just turn out to be a waiter,""was the way he hit me back. <br><br> For, as it turned out, Dillard was compelled to return to Fonda for some reason and could not fulfill the Sunday understanding.",theodore-dreiser_an-american-tragedy
set up,"""Oh, I don’t know,""she retorted, not a little intrigued by this cash offer, as it were, and at the same time not a little set up in her mood by the fact that she could thus inflame nearly all youths in this way. <br><br> Having crossed the street and reached the first intersection beyond, they paused and looked around as though they had reached their destination - the man putting down his organ which he proceeded to open - setting up, as he did so, a small but adequate music rack. <br><br> And Clyde, noticing this, was quite set up by it, for he could not help but feel that this in itself, and apart from whatever his cousin Gilbert might either think or wish to do, might easily presage some favor on the part of his uncle that might lead to some good for him.",theodore-dreiser_an-american-tragedy

stay out,"He explained that he had decided to stay out a little while longer. <br><br> What difference did it make if he stayed out late once in a while? <br><br> A clock somewhere striking two, it suddenly occurred to Rita that she must be going - her parents would object to her staying out so late.",theodore-dreiser_an-american-tragedy
lean over,"And frizzled-haired Dutch Lena now leaned over to say:""I take it and him too, you bet, if you don’t want him. <br><br> And after Clyde had gone away and Roberta was working as before, she leaned over and whispered:""He says she’ll do already."" <br><br> For just as Gilbert was approaching, Lena Schlict, who was working beside her, leaned over to say:""Here comes Mr. Gilbert Griffiths.",theodore-dreiser_an-american-tragedy
blow off,"The wind blew my hat off, and we - she and I - got up at the same time to reach for it and the boat upset - that’s all. <br><br> By admitting that the wind had blown his hat off, Clyde had intimated that he had worn a hat on the lake, but not necessarily the straw hat found on the water.",theodore-dreiser_an-american-tragedy
