# Script Output Rule

When running Python scripts or terminal commands:

1. **ALWAYS show output** — never run scripts silently
2. **Use `2>&1`** to capture both stdout and stderr
3. **For long-running scripts** — use `tee` to write to both console and log file:
   ```bash
   uv run python script.py 2>&1 | tee logs/script_output.log
   ```
4. **For background processes** — redirect to a log file and tail it:
   ```bash
   uv run python script.py > logs/output.log 2>&1 &
   tail -f logs/output.log
   ```

The user needs to see what's happening to understand progress and debug issues.
